Code used in the manuscript

The codes here is used for plotting bias-corrected outputs as time-series (in Alaska for example).
Here we calculate the regional averaged time-series using 3-month time window from the bias-corrected output (i.e., eqm).
It includes historical observation (Daymet for Alaska), eqm-corrected outputs for historical and future projections (historical, ssp126, ssp245, ssp370, ssp585).
